### Hi there!

I'm Jesse or @MousseRoyale from Australia, and I love coding.

I am currently undergoing a bachelor of computing at Curtin University where I major in cyber security. I always try to have a personal project ongoing. They include things like building Honeypots/SIEMs or even Godot game development.
